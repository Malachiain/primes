# primes

This is code I wrote to explore the ideas I had learned in my cryptography course
It is called primes because each of the files is concerned with finding if a number
is prime, or finding its prime factors.

Finding prime factors of numbers can get you in trouble if you factorise the wrong number.
I do not endorse or condone such an activity. If you really do want to find prime factors
I encourage you to find more efficient implementations. The idea of all the code here is that
it is possible to understand what is going on, not work fast.
